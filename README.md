## Note
Hey, We had a problem with the repositories, we found out in the day after we submitted the repository that we worked on the repository of the ex2, so we had to fork the repository and create new one so you will be able to check our project correctly
We sent an email to Yotam and he said that it's ok and just write about it in the readme so you'll know that we finish in time the exercise and the last commits are for the the forks and organize the code so nothing won't be wrong
Thank you for checking our App :)
